    <h1>Chicken Fried Rice</h1>

    <p>Chicken Fried Rice is one of the best weeknight dinners around!</p>
    <p>It’s a homemade version of my favorite take-out classic.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong> Brown rice – </strong>
        leftover rice from the day before works best. White rice will work great
        here too.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> Chicken breasts – </strong>
        I like to dice the chicken into very small pieces about 1/2 – 3/4-inch,
        it makes it the perfect size for this fried rice.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Toasted sesame oil – </strong>
        this oil is very strong and a little goes a long way. This ingredient
        adds lots of flavor to this dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Vegetable oil (or canola oil) –</strong>
        this is used for sautéing (along with the sesame oil so you won’t use to
        much of that and sesame oil on it’s own has a low smoke point).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Frozen peas and carrots blend –</strong>
        I like to use the frozen vegetable here to save time, but fresh will
        work too you’ll just have to longer so they’ll become tender enough.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Green onions –</strong>
        feel free to add more green onions to taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Garlic – </strong>
        only use fresh garlic here for best flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> Eggs – </strong>
        you can add 3 eggs here to stretch the recipe a bit. If it’s easier for
        you, you can stir in a bowl with a fork first then add to the skillet.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Low-sodium soy sauce –</strong>
        if you have regular sodium soy sauce that will work too, just start with
        2 Tbsp and add more if needed.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
